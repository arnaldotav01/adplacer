Title: AdPlacer: Relevant ads, when you want them! [Product]

Author/s: Arnaldo Tavares

Abstract: We are all daily bombarded with advertisements everywhere: from billboards on streets to social media apps, we receive annoying and irrelevant ads on a regular basis. What if there is a product that learns our habits (what we consume) and routine (when we consume) and only gives us relevant advertisements at the moment we are available to consider them? AdPlacer is this product! By collecting data on users' consumption habits and routine, AdPlacer can learn their preferences (for example, a perfume brand) and send them a related ad only when they are available (for example, when they are waiting for their order in a restaurant). In this project, we will work on AdPlacer's MVP (Minimum Viable Product), leveraging Yelp's public datasets to learn customers habits (favorite business/products, based on their feedback) and routine (where and when they are when consuming, based on their check-ins) to identify relevant products and the right moment to advertise. Expect to work as a cohesive team in the full spectrum of a product's lifecycle: its conception beyond this basic idea, creation of a business model, and the entire data science workflow to create explainable predictive models, going from data acquisition to inference optimization. Although ideally we have experts in each leadership role, the idea is to work collaboratively to share knowledge and experience while building this great product!

Requirements (from multiple team members):
Product/Program/Project Management/Business Development experience and leadership (Author provides from different roles at NVIDIA, Intel, AWS, and startups);
Strong coding/SW development skills (for Software Engineering leadership);
Strong Data Science fundamentals (for Data Science leadership);
Strong ML fundamentals (for ML Engineering leadership);
(Desirable) Good coding/GUI design experience (for UX leadership).
